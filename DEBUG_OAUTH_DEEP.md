# Deep OAuth Debugging

## Known Facts
1. ✅ GCP URI configuration is correct (user confirmed)
2. ✅ Application environment variables are correct
3. ✅ OAuth2Client initialization is correct
4. ✅ Server callback endpoint exists and responds
5. ❌ Google still returns redirect_uri_mismatch

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. Domain Resolution Issue
- Google's servers might resolve the domain differently
- DNS propagation delays
- Regional DNS differences

### 2. SSL/TLS Certificate Issues
- Google might reject callback if SSL certificate is invalid
- Mixed HTTP/HTTPS issues

### 3. Google OAuth Client Configuration Issues
- Multiple OAuth clients with same domain
- OAuth client in wrong Google Cloud project
- Cached configuration in Google's systems

### 4. Environment Variable Loading Issue
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID mismatch between app and GCP
- Environment variables not loading correctly

### 5. OAuth Scope Issues
- Requested scopes might not match OAuth client configuration
- Classroom API scopes might require additional verification

## Next Debugging Steps
1. Verify exact OAuth client configuration in GCP
2. Test with minimal OAuth scopes
3. Check SSL certificate validity
4. Verify Google Cloud project has correct APIs enabled
5. Test callback endpoint accessibility from external sources

## Critical Information Needed
- Exact error message from Google OAuth flow
- Network request/response details
- Google Cloud Console screenshot of OAuth client config
