# Database Write Operations Audit

## ❌ CURRENT STATE: Database Writes Are NOT Centralized

### Direct Storage Write Calls Found

#### User Management (server/routes.ts)
- `storage.createApiKey(userId, {...})` - API key creation
- Various user update operations scattered throughout

#### Document Management (server/routes.ts)
- `storage.createDocument(customerUuid, validationResult.data)` - Document creation
- Document processing writes in multiple locations

#### Teacher Overrides (server/routes.ts)
- `storage.createTeacherOverride(customerUuid, validationResult.data)` - Override creation
- `storage.updateTeacherOverride(existingOverride.id, validationResult.data)` - Override updates
- `storage.revertToAI(questionId, customerUuid)` - Override reversion

#### Document Processing Service (server/services/documentProcessor.ts)
- `storage.createQuestion(...)` - Question creation during document processing
- `storage.createAIResponse(...)` - AI response storage
- `storage.createProcessedResult(...)` - Processing result storage
- Multiple processing-related writes

#### Google Integration (server/storage.ts)
- Direct database writes for user creation/updates
- Classroom and student synchronization writes
- Token management writes

### Issues with Current Approach
- ❌ **Scattered write logic**: Database writes happen throughout the application
- ❌ **No centralized business logic**: Write operations mixed with route logic
- ❌ **Inconsistent error handling**: Different error patterns for different write operations
- ❌ **No centralized validation**: Validation logic spread across multiple files
- ❌ **No centralized auditing**: No single place to log or track database changes
- ❌ **Difficult to maintain**: Changes to write logic require updates in multiple places

### Recommended Solution: DatabaseWriteService

Create a centralized `DatabaseWriteService` that:
1. **Centralizes all write operations** - Single service for all database mutations
2. **Enforces business rules** - Consistent validation and business logic
3. **Provides audit logging** - Track all database changes in one place
4. **Standardizes error handling** - Consistent error responses
5. **Manages transactions** - Coordinate complex multi-table operations
6. **Integrates with existing services** - Work with ActiveUserService and CustomerLookupService

### Architecture Should Be:
```
Routes → ActiveUserService → DatabaseWriteService → Storage Layer
Routes → CustomerLookupService → DatabaseWriteService → Storage Layer
```

Instead of current:
```
Routes → Direct Storage Calls (scattered everywhere)
```

## CONCLUSION: WRITE CENTRALIZATION NEEDED
Database writes are currently scattered throughout the application and need to be centralized through a dedicated service layer for consistency, maintainability, and proper business logic enforcement.
