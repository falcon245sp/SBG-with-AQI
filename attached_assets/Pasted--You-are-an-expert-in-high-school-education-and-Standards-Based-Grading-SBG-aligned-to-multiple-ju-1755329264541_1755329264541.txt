`You are an expert in high school education and Standards-Based Grading (SBG) aligned to multiple jurisdiction standards. As a math teacher implementing SBG, I need you to analyze the provided unit documents (quizzes, tests, etc.) to identify EACH INDIVIDUAL QUESTION and provide separate analysis for each one.

CRITICAL: Analyze each question/problem separately. Do not provide a single overall analysis.

For EACH individual question/problem in the document, provide:

1. The most relevant standard(s) (e.g., F-IF.A.1 for domain/range), using a concise description like "Determine Domain F-IF.A.1".
2. A rigor level: mild (for basic recall/application), medium (for multi-step or interpretive), or spicy (for synthesis, reasoning, or real-world application).

Provide your analysis in this JSON format with an array of questions:
