# Document Processing Service

## Current Version: 0.8 (Development Fork)

## Overview

The Document Processing Service is a full-stack web application that provides AI-powered educational document analysis. The system automatically analyzes educational documents (PDFs, Word docs, Google Docs) to identify standards alignment and determine cognitive rigor levels using multiple AI engines (ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude). The application features a RESTful API backend with Express.js and a modern React frontend with TypeScript, providing educational institutions and EdTech companies with automated document processing capabilities.

## Version History

### Version 0.8 (August 17, 2025) - Google OAuth & Classroom Integration ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- **Google OAuth Authentication**: Google authentication workflow development 
  - Google OAuth 2.0 integration with proper scope management
  - Secure token storage and automatic refresh handling
  - User profile management with Google account linking
  - **FIXED**: Token expiration handling - automatic refresh for returning users
  - **CRITICAL SYSTEM-LEVEL ISSUE**: OAuth URL rewriting by Replit platform causing authentication failures
    - **SYMPTOM**: All OAuth URLs redirect to development domain despite correct configuration
    - **EVIDENCE**: Manual URL construction with hardcoded production domain still generates development URLs
    - **ROOT CAUSE**: Replit platform intercepts and rewrites OAuth URLs from production to development domain
    - **IMPACT**: Environment variable `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` is correctly set but ignored by system-level URL rewriting
    - **TECHNICAL DETAILS**: 
      - Environment vars show: `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN=be365067-8647-49d0-ac80-367c87b1cbcc-00-330w27orl8pv0.janeway.replit.dev`
      - Even manually constructed URLs get rewritten from production to development domain
      - This affects ALL OAuth providers, not just Google
    - **SUPPORTABILITY CRISIS**: Cannot rely on environment variables for critical authentication configuration
  - **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CONCERN**: Replit OAuth patterns don't translate to production deployments outside Replit
    - Google search confirms: "Issues can arise when transitioning from working development setup on Replit to production deployment"
    - Need authentication solution that works reliably across deployment environments
    - **SOLUTION**: Implement traditional username/password authentication with secure session management
  - **IMPLEMENTED**: Comprehensive error tracking with 6 unique line identifiers for precise debugging
    - `[LINE 179]` - General callback error  
    - `[LINE 341]` - No googleId in session (getCurrentUser)
    - `[LINE 350]` - Session expired >5 days (getCurrentUser)
    - `[LINE 361]` - User not found in database (getCurrentUser)
    - `[LINE 392]` - Token refresh failed (getCurrentUser)
    - `[LINE 399]` - No refresh token available (getCurrentUser)
- **Google Classroom Integration**: Automated roster and class management
  - Google Classroom API integration for course data
  - Automatic student roster synchronization with pagination support
  - Real-time classroom and student data updates
  - Support for multiple classes per teacher
  - **FIXED**: Student roster pagination issue - now correctly retrieves all students (34/34 for Period 2 Algebra 1)
- **Database Schema Expansion**: Enhanced data models for educational workflows
  - Extended users table with Google OAuth fields and token management
  - New classrooms table with Google Classroom course data
  - New students table with Google profile integration
  - Proper foreign key relationships and data integrity
- **Authentication Flow**: Seamless user onboarding experience development
  - Multi-step authentication with Google OAuth
  - Classroom connection and data synchronization
  - Progress tracking through setup stages
  - Automatic redirection based on authentication state
  - **FIXED**: Token refresh logic integrated into `/api/auth/user` endpoint for seamless re-authentication
  - **ENHANCED**: Forced re-authentication every 5 days for security compliance, even with valid sessions

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Standards Sherpa Platform Persona

The platform is personified as "Standards Sherpa" or "Sherpa" for short - a knowledgeable guide who helps teachers navigate educational standards and analysis. Standards Sherpa represents:
- Expert guidance through complex educational terrain
- Collaborative partnership with teachers as a trusted guide
- Reliability and trustworthiness in educational analysis
- Clear, approachable communication style
- Support for teacher judgment and expertise

All user-facing references use "Standards Sherpa" or "Sherpa" instead of generic "AI" terms to create a more personal, educational relationship. The persona suggests cartoon sherpa iconography for branding to reinforce the guiding, supportive nature of the platform.
