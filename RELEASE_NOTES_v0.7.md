# Standards Sherpa v0.7 Release Notes
**Release Date:** August 18, 2025

## 🏗️ Major Architectural Milestone: DatabaseWriteService Implementation

Version 0.7 represents a significant architectural achievement with the complete implementation of a centralized three-layer architecture that provides robust separation of concerns and enterprise-level maintainability.

## ✅ Architecture Transformation Complete

### Before v0.7: Scattered Write Operations
- Database writes scattered throughout application layers
- Inconsistent error handling across operations
- Mixed business logic with route handling
- No centralized audit trails
- Difficult maintenance and debugging

### After v0.7: Centralized DatabaseWriteService Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Application Routes          │ ← HTTP endpoints only
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────┐
│      DatabaseWriteService          │ ← Centralized business logic
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────┐
│         Storage Layer              │ ← Pure data access
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
