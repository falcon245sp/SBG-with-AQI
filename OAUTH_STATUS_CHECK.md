# OAuth Status Check - August 17, 2025

## Current Situation
- OAuth flow initiates successfully ✅
- Redirect URI configured correctly in application ✅
- No callback processing in server logs ❌
- Error: `{"error":"Authentication failed"}` received

## Analysis
The OAuth flow reaches Google successfully but Google is NOT calling our callback endpoint. This confirms the redirect URI mismatch in Google Cloud Console.

## Evidence
1. **OAuth URL generated correctly:**
   ```
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdocu-proc-serv-jfielder1.replit.app%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fgoogle%2Fcallback
   ```

2. **No callback logs:** Server shows OAuth initiation but no callback processing

3. **Error pattern:** Generic authentication failed suggests callback never reached server

## Required Action
The redirect URI `https://docu-proc-serv-jfielder1.replit.app/api/auth/google/callback` must be added to Google Cloud Console OAuth client.

**Verification needed:**
1. Check if URI was actually saved in GCP (browser refresh after adding)
2. Verify correct OAuth client ID is being edited
3. Consider creating new OAuth client if current one has issues

## Alternative: Deploy to Production
Deploying to Replit would provide a stable `.replit.app` domain that won't change, eliminating the redirect URI mismatch issue permanently.
