# OAuth Configuration Status

## Current Status: Waiting for GCP Propagation

**Configuration Applied**: Added "Authorized JavaScript origins" to GCP OAuth client

**Time Added**: ~5:12 PM UTC (just now)

**Expected Propagation Time**: 5-10 minutes from configuration change

## What's Happening
Google Cloud Console changes need time to propagate across Google's global infrastructure. Even though the configuration looks correct in the console, the OAuth servers may still be using the cached old configuration.

## Testing Instructions

### Wait Period
**Wait until**: 5:18-5:22 PM UTC (5-10 minutes from now)

### Test Steps (After Wait Period)
1. Try the OAuth flow again from the browser
2. If it still fails, check the server logs for detailed error information
3. The enhanced error logging will show if it's still a redirect_uri_mismatch

### Expected Results After Propagation
- ✅ Successful Google OAuth authentication
- ✅ Redirect to callback page with user data
- ✅ Access to 8 classrooms and 187 students

### If Still Failing After 10 Minutes
- May need to create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- Could indicate other GCP configuration issues
- Will investigate API enablement and consent screen setup

## Current Configuration Status
- ✅ Application correctly configured
- ✅ Environment variables correct
- ✅ OAuth2Client using production redirect URI
- ✅ GCP Authorized JavaScript origins added
- ✅ GCP Authorized redirect URIs confirmed
- ⏳ Waiting for Google's server propagation
